requires postgres setup

Sql creates have been provided and an init script available for yarn/npm init in node-server folder - the setup of the database is left to the user discretion ( due to mac/win differences - though that could be resolved with a postgres set up in a docker container )

then needs only a node instance for api calls (yarn/npm start in node-server folder)

Then another yarn/npm start at the root level


Testing and frontend were left to the wayside, as setting up the database and backend was more time consuming as initally thought.

Initally started the project with typescript, but jettisoned that midway, as I didn't feel it contribute enough when taking account to my comfort with it.
