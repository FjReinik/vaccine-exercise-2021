requires postgres setup

Sql creates have been provided and an init script available for yarn/npm init in node-server folder - the setup of the database is left to the user discretion ( due to mac/win differences - though that could be resolved with a postgres set up in a docker container )

then needs only a node instance for api calls (yarn/npm start in node-server folder)

Then another yarn/npm start at the root level

This is an updated version - worked on after 15.8 as I wasn't happy with the results that I managed to send at that time. The state of which is stored in another branch. This however should be more representative of my competence.
